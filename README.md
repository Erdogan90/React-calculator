# React-calculator
Following along a tutorial in my first attempt at using react and building a functional Calculator


##Process
In our first week of React to help me get a better understanding of how hooks, components and props work.
This basic calculator has taught me syntax around React as well as how to put together a project. 
I will take this knowledge from this small project and improve on my knowledge as we carry on working through the Bootcamp.
